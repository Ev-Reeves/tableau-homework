A few changes have taken place in Citi Bike's ridership since the beginning of COVID.  Specifically, comparing the past four months of the pandemic and the same four months of last year, Citi Bike's user population has become older (in terms of birth year), and has started to take longer rides.  The data do not present a clear explanation for the change in ages in the user population.  It is possible that older riders perceive the service as offering a safer mode of transportation relative to a bus or train.  The increase in ride lengths is likely due to the general increase in 'free time.'  There may be an interaction effect, such that a) people generally have more free time, and b) older people are more interested in using that time to ride bikes.  It is unlikely that this effect would be statistically significant, since most of the increase in ride lengths seems to have have been driven by younger riders.  Except for the beginning of the period in question, Citi Bike seems to be handling the pandemic well.
